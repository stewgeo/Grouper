There are three options to create new groups:
* Create a new group using current selections.
  * Only one field may contain selections
  * Can not create new calculated dimensions from existing calculated dimensions
* Create a new group by choosing a field and then selecting the values you'd like to include in the group
* Create a new group by choosing a field and then dragging values into bins
